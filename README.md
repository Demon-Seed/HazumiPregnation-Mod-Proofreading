* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Use the default for everything. Just keep clicking Next)
* Motivation to learn

4. At the top click on Terminal > New Terminal. Enter the following: `git clone [URL_YOU_COPIED_ABOVE]`.
5. Copy the contents of the new folder created with git clone into the game folder and replace all.
6. Your source control menu should be good to go and look like this.

Now you are all setup, all you need to do is play the game and look for any changes that need to be made. Stuff like spelling errors, wrong names, inconsistencies, spacing issues, etc.

7. Use the FIND functionality to search for what you are trying to fix. For example if a character's name is wrong, type that into the search menu and start looking, then make the change. Try not to mess with any scripts or variables you might see.
